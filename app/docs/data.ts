* Transparent on-chain transfer fee mechanism
* Verified mint address for security
* Community governance alignment
* Educational utility integration

## Use Cases

* Access to Vaulted Academy curriculum
* Reward mechanism for contribution
* Community participation token

## Token Address

**Verified Mint:** \`DTe8U4RnErPN1CKiJ5HcyZPEAGXMg6j6ueindYuowfjV\`

**Blockchain:** Solana (SPL Token)

**Verification:** View on [Solscan](https://solscan.io/token/DTe8U4RnErPN1CKiJ5HcyZPEAGXMg6j6ueindYuowfjV)

## Token Economics

### Supply

* Initial Supply: Defined at token creation

* No hidden mechanisms

## Tokenomics

The IV-SOL tokenomics are designed to:

* Align long-term participant incentives

* Fund community infrastructure
* Reward educational contribution

## Token Security

* Managed through established Solana infrastructure
* Standard SPL token implementation
* Community verification encouraged
* Transparent on-chain operations`,

## Server-Authoritative Architecture

Iron Vault uses a server-authoritative design for all identity and progress management:

* Role-based access control at all layers
* Protected identity verification
* Controlled administrative functions
* Audit logging for all operations

## Control Mechanisms

* **Idempotent Progress Events:** Prevents duplicate progress recording
* **Fraud Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities
* **Backup & Recovery:** Regular backups with disaster recovery procedures
* **Operational Review:** Scheduled security audits and reviews

## Smart Contract Considerations

When interacting with IV-SOL:

* Verify token address before transactions
* Use established Solana wallets and tools
* Beware of impersonator tokens
* Only swap through verified routes (Jupiter)

## Risk Disclosure

Users should be aware of:

* Smart contract risks inherent to blockchain
* Market volatility and liquidity conditions
* No guaranteed execution prices
* Dependency on Solana network stability

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly to the Iron Vault team rather than disclosing publicly.`,

    title: "How to Swap",
    category: "Guides",
    description: "Step-by-step guide to swapping for IV-SOL using Jupiter.",
    content: `# How to Swap for IV-SOL

## Quick Start

1. Visit the [Swap page](/swap)
2. Connect a supported Solana wallet
3. Select input token (SOL or other supported assets)
4. Output will be locked to verified IV-SOL
5. Review the quote and confirm swap

## Prerequisites

* A Solana blockchain wallet (Phantom, Magic Eden, Solflare, etc.)
* SOL or other supported assets
* Active internet connection

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Connect Wallet

Click the wallet connection button on the swap interface. Select your wallet provider from the available options. Approve the connection in your wallet application.

### Step 2: Select Input Token

Choose the token you want to swap FROM. Most common:
* SOL (Solana native token)
* Other SPL tokens (USDC, USDT, etc.)

### Step 3: Enter Amount

Input the amount you want to swap. The interface will fetch current market rates and display the estimated IV-SOL you'll receive.

### Step 4: Review Output

The output token is locked to verified IV-SOL to prevent accidental swaps to impersonator tokens.

**Verified IV-SOL Mint:** \`DTe8U4RnErPN1CKiJ5HcyZPEAGXMg6j6ueindYuowfjV\`

### Step 5: Confirm Swap

Review the quote, including:
* Input amount
* Output amount
* Estimated price impact
* Network fees

Click confirm and approve the transaction in your wallet.

### Step 6: Wait for Confirmation

The transaction will be processed on the Solana blockchain. This typically takes a few seconds to a minute.

## Liquidity & Routing

Swaps are routed by Jupiter based on real-time market liquidity. Jupiter finds the best route across multiple DEXes:

* If no route exists, the interface will display "No route"
* This reflects market conditions, not a technical failure
* Check back later or try swapping to a different token pair

## Fees

Transaction fees include:
* **Network Fee:** Solana blockchain transaction cost (~0.00025 SOL)
* **Jupiter Router Fee:** Included in price quote
* **IV-SOL Transfer Fee:** Applies to received tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Won't Connect
* Refresh the page
* Check wallet browser extension is enabled
* Try a different wallet provider
* Ensure wallet has SOL for gas fees

### No Route Available
* Insufficient liquidity in current market
* Try swapping a smaller amount
* Check back in a few minutes
* Verify the token is supported

### Transaction Failed
* Insufficient balance for network fees
* Price slippage tolerance too low
* Wallet rejected the transaction
* Network congestion`,
