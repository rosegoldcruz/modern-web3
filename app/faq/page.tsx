      {
        q: "What is Iron Vault?",
        a: "Iron Vault is a financial education platform built by Commonwealth Ventures LLC. We teach everyday people how real estate, digital assets, and passive income systems actually work — in plain English, before asking them to do anything. The Iron Vault Token (IV-SOL) is the ecosystem's utility layer, built on Solana.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who is this for?",
        a: "Anyone who was never taught how wealth actually works. If school didn't cover compound interest, real estate investing, or how digital assets fit into the modern economy — this is where you start. We specifically built this for people 18–35 who are tired of feeling locked out of financial systems.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I have to buy a token to participate?",
        a: "No. Start with the education. The courses, the community, and the learning materials exist independently of any token purchase. Understand the system first. Participate when it makes sense for you.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who runs this?",
        a: "Commonwealth Ventures LLC — a legally registered Arizona domestic LLC (Entity ID: 23883142), formed September 15, 2025, and active in good standing with the Arizona Corporation Commission. This is a real business with real accountability.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "The Education Platform",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What will I actually learn?",
        a: "The fundamentals that most people were never taught: how compound interest works, how real estate generates income, what tokenization means and why it matters, how decentralized infrastructure differs from traditional banking, and how to evaluate any financial opportunity — crypto or otherwise — without getting burned.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does the education cost?",
        a: "Entry-level courses start at accessible price points designed for people just getting started. We're not gatekeeping knowledge behind high ticket prices. The goal is a large, informed community — not a small, wealthy one.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the education connected to the token?",
        a: "The education stands on its own as a product. You get real value from the courses whether you ever interact with the token or not. That's intentional — we believe education should come before any financial decision, including ours.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "The Iron Vault Token (IV-SOL)",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What is IV-SOL?",
        a: "IV-SOL is a utility token built on Solana using the Token 2022 program. It's the access and participation layer of the Iron Vault ecosystem — used for community governance, ecosystem participation, and future platform features as the infrastructure builds out.",
      },
      {
        q: "When is the token launching?",
        a: "The full token launch is planned for November 2026. We are currently in the community-building and education phase. Early access positions are available for founding members who want to be part of the ecosystem from the ground up.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the 6% transaction fee and where does it go?",
        a: "IV-SOL uses the Token 2022 transfer fee extension — a Solana-native feature that applies a 6% fee on token transfers. That fee is split: 3% funds Commonwealth Ventures operations (development, acquisitions, infrastructure) and 3% flows back into the ecosystem for community participants. The exact on-chain distribution mechanism will be published in the whitepaper.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is IV-SOL an investment?",
        a: "IV-SOL is a utility token. It is not a stock, bond, or security. It does not represent equity in Commonwealth Ventures LLC. Participation in the ecosystem does not guarantee any financial return. Crypto markets are volatile. Only engage with what you fully understand and can afford to lose.",
      },
      {
        q: "How is the token supply distributed?",
        a: "Total supply is 250,000,000,000 IV-SOL. Full tokenomics — including allocation, vesting schedules, and liquidity plans — will be published in the Iron Vault Whitepaper ahead of the November launch. We do not release partial tokenomics. When it's published, it will be complete.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Real Estate & the Roadmap",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What does real estate have to do with a crypto token?",
        a: "Real estate is the world's most proven wealth-building asset class. Iron Vault's long-term vision is to bring real-world commercial assets — properties that generate actual income — on-chain, so that access to that kind of asset is no longer reserved for the wealthy. We're building the infrastructure for that. The education platform is Phase 1. Asset acquisition is Phase 2.",
      },
      {
        q: "What kinds of assets are you looking to acquire?",
        a: "Commercial properties — shopping centers, franchise locations, gas stations, and similar income-producing assets. No acquisitions have been announced yet. When they happen, they will be reported transparently.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the stablecoin you mention?",
        a: "Phase 3 of the Iron Vault roadmap involves a stablecoin backed by the real-world assets acquired in Phase 2. This is a long-term objective, not an immediate offering. It will only exist after the underlying asset base is in place.",
      },
      {
        q: "What phase are you in right now?",
        a: "Phase 1 — community building and education. We are enrolling founding members, building the education platform, and establishing the infrastructure (CRM, funnels, governance systems) that everything else runs on. This is the foundation. We are building it correctly before moving to the next phase.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Trust & Transparency",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How do I know this is legitimate?",
        a: "Commonwealth Ventures LLC is verifiable in 30 seconds on the Arizona Corporation Commission's public business search at azcc.gov — Entity ID 23883142, active, in good standing. The IV-SOL token contract is publicly visible on Solscan at address DTe8U4RnErPN1CKiJ5HcyZPEAGXMg6j6ueindYuowfjV. We are not anonymous. We are not hiding.",
      },
      {
        q: "Has the token been audited?",
        a: "A full smart contract audit is part of the pre-launch checklist before November. We will publish the results when complete. We will not launch without it.",
      },
      {
        q: "What are the real risks here?",
        a: "The honest risks: crypto markets are highly volatile and IV-SOL may lose value. The real estate acquisition roadmap depends on execution that hasn't happened yet. The stablecoin is a future concept, not a current product. The education platform is early stage. We are building in public, and not everything is finished. Anyone who tells you crypto is risk-free is lying to you.",
      },
      {
        q: "What should I do before participating in anything?",
        a: "Learn first. Use our education platform. Understand how tokens work, how real estate generates income, and how to evaluate any opportunity critically — including this one. We built the education layer precisely so that nobody has to make uninformed decisions. Start there.",
